1.)Schools who had higher overall budgets and budgets per student ended up having the worse scores and passing percentages in compairsion to schools with a smaller budget. In fact schools who had the lowest budget performed the best!

2.) which makes sense because because in theory a school with the need of a bigger budget than other schools could point to the fact that they might be a larger school and the data supports the finding that larger schools performed statiscally worse in every category (Math Avg, Reading Avg, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Passing Overall) than "Medium" & "Small" Schools.

3.) Charter Schools out performed District schools in all statistical categories (Math Avg, Reading Avg, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Passing Overall) by an average of 14.75%.
